should put a max results limit


we need to keep the tracks recently foudn in the search list in memory?

Then that means keeping the process alive in memory. But we can also
just run the search again and find the track by index.

Tried Macruby but it is too hard to get either multithreaded DRb or
sinatra working

Vimscript can remember the last command send to system() and just append
an index number to it



Store lists like in Vmail
Put databaseID off screen and use it to look up anything
